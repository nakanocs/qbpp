# QUBO++ Document
This documentation for QUBO++ is currently under development.
Some pages may contain incomplete or provisional information.
Feedback and contributions are welcome as the documentation continues to evolve.

## Installation
This section explains how to install QUBO++ and set up the required environment.
It also describes the license management process needed to use QUBO++.
After completing this section, you will be ready to follow the tutorial
and start modeling and solving optimization problems with QUBO++.

1. [Installation and License Management](INSTALL)

## Basics
This section provides a step-by-step introduction to QUBO++.
By reading the pages in order, you will learn how to define variables and expressions,
model optimization problems, and solve them using QUBO++.
After completing this tutorial, you should be able to use QUBO++ for most typical applications.
