# QUBO++
* A C++ library for constructing polynomials of binary variables to solve combinatorial optimization problems  
* Currently built for **x86_64 Linux systems**  
* Bundled with two CPU solvers: Easy Solver (heuristic) and Exhaustive Solver (complete search)  
* Bundled with a GPU solver: ABS3  
* Supports High-order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) up to degree 8  
* Multithreading acceleration is applied using oneTBB wherever possible  
* Includes APIs for calling the Gurobi Optimizer to solve Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems

# QUBO++ Solvers: Easy Solver, Exhaustive Solver, ABS3 Solver
## Easy Solver
* Searches for solutions to QUBO/HUBO formulations on x86_64 multicore processors.
* Multithreaded acceleration: utilizes Intel oneTBB for parallel search.
* Integer coefficients: supports coefficients of arbitrary magnitude.

## Exhaustive Solver
* Enumerates all solutions to QUBO/HUBO formulations on x86_64 multicore processors.
* Optimality guaranteed: the global optimum is found and certifiable.
* Multithreaded acceleration: utilizes Intel oneTBB for parallel enumeration.
* Integer coefficients: supports coefficients of arbitrary magnitude.

## ABS3 Solver
* Searches for solutions to QUBO/HUBO formulations on CUDA-enabled GPUs in x86_64 hosts.

## Build Environment
The following environment was used to build QUBO++.  
To ensure compatibility, please use the same or newer versions of the listed components.
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS 
- **glibc**: 2.31  
- **C++ Standard**: C++17  
- **Compiler**: g++ 9.4.0  
- **Boost**: 1.81.0
- **CUDA**: 12.8

## oneTBB / TBB dependency
QUBO++ does not bundle TBB. We include TBB headers in public APIs, but the
library itself does not require linking against TBB for the default use cases.
- **Build & run verified on**: Ubuntu 20.04 (classic TBB 2020.1), 22.04 / 24.04 (oneTBB 2021+).

# QUBO++ Licensing

## License Types
QUBO++ uses Cryptlex for license management.
When activating a node-locked license, some information about the execution environment (e.g., hardware identifiers) is securely stored on Cryptlex servers to verify the license.

- **Anonymous Trial**  
  - No license key required  
  - Valid for 7 days  
  - Maximum variable count: **1,000 (CPU) / 1,000 (GPU)**  

- **Registered Trial**  
  - Requires a free license key  
  - Valid for 30 days  
  - Maximum variable count: **10,000 (CPU) / 10,000 (GPU)**  

- **Standard License**  
  - Requires a paid license key  
  - Valid for the duration of the license agreement  
  - Maximum variable count: **2,147,483,647 ($2^{31} - 1$) (CPU) / 1,000 (GPU)**  
  - *Practically, the maximum variable count may be limited by available physical memory.*  

- **Professional License**  
  - Requires a paid license key  
  - Valid for the duration of the license agreement  
  - Maximum variable count: **2,147,483,647 ($2^{31} - 1$) (CPU) / 2,147,483,647 ($2^{31} - 1$) (GPU)**  
  - *Practically, the maximum variable count may be limited by available physical memory.*  

- **Fallback (No license / Expired license)**

## How to Set the License

For **Registered Trial**, **Standard License**, and **Professional License**, set the license key using either of the following methods:

- **Via Code**:
  ```cpp
  qbpp::license_key("XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX");
  ```
- **Via Environment Variable**:
  ```bash
  export QBPP_LICENSE_KEY=XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXXXXX
  ```
